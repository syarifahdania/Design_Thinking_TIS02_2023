During the visit to UTM Digital, I was able to observe how technology is integrated into the educational environment. 
This Â involves the use of digital tools such as UTM Smart and UTM portal, online resources, and innovative teaching methods
that leverage technology to enhance the learning experience. I was shown with how the university is preparing students for
the demands of a digital workforce by exposing them to cutting-edge technologies and teaching them digital skills 
that are increasingly essential in various professions.
