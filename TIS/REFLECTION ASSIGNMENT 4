My visit to Petronas and Huawei had been an enlightening and an eye-opening 
experience as we were able to receive valuable insights upon ICT from both companies. 
The visit to Petronas Digital has thought us that Petronas has long been laying the groundwork for the ongoing
digital revolution by investing in fundamental building blocks for digital growth, such as Internet Of Things (IoT),
connectivity, cloud, security, process automation and analytics. We learned that even in an oil and gas company,
digitalisation is necessary in order to  cut costs, improve efficiency in terms of communication, processes and workflow, 
as well as to increase agility and profits consequently resulting in a better work
environment and customer experience.
