The visit at both Petronas and Huawei was not merely a tour of facilities but an eye-opening exploration of a revolution. 
All the representatives from both companies discussed and revealed the ongoing efforts to deploy cutting-edge technologies including 5G networks, 
overall cloud storage, and advanced networking and communication systems in order to meet the evolving demands of a digital society. 
Being able to learn about the things thatoperates in the background of our lives deepened the appreciation I have towards the world that we live in today.
