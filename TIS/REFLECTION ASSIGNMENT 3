As the world is rapidly evolving with advanced technologies, I understand the importance of adaptability. The ever-evolving tech landscape requires continuous
learning in order to stay relevant in the industry. I planned to keep myself being updated with the latest developments in software development,
programming languages, frameworks, and industry trends. I will also build connections with people 
that are well experienced in this industry so that I can learn on a more broad spectrum while also sharpening my soft skills as it is also
in order to become a successful system developer.
