The talks held by GetMe Hired and PPG had given me more insights realistically on how should 
I collectively improvise myself in order to be prepared and ready to enter the working life.
I also got to learn about the job prospects of a Data Engineer which is super important in order
for me to prepare myself for the reality of being in this field. I am now more determined of my 
future since I have got a clear view on the path that I am currently taking to achieve my professional
goals in ICT. Careers in ICT plays a meaningful role in industry. This is because ICT is essential to increase a 
companyâ€™s efficiency and ability to react immediately to client needs. ICT can help with design, production, R&D, 
distribution, sales, and customer feedback, among other business operations. Hence making careers in ICT crucial to the industry.
